## Overview

### Project description

A weather forecast web app to get the weather forecast of your nearby location with ease.

### Links

## My process

### Built with

-   semantic HTML5
-   CSS3
-   JavaScript fetch April
-   [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)

### Code concerns

You might notice my OpenWeatherMap API token key is exposed in the JavaScript. As a security concern, this might not be recommended. Actually, this is a demo project and that token key being exposed doesn't really matter as this isn't an official build.

## Further development

-   **Integration of live weather forecast changes update**: I'm planning to see if I might add live updates feature, so that when you search a location's weather forecast, any changes to the weather forecast from the server-side would be updated automatically.
